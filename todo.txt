add multi frequency bandpass

make dust scaling compatible with bandpass filter

add exceptions for existence of component models

pass scale_freqs only synch and out

check that 10. samples is sufficient

remove bandpass_model parameter in function.

output only the sum of chosen components by default

add seed for numpy random stuff. np.random.seed(seed). do this in taylens (simulate_tebp_correlated) and in noise realisation.

change polarisation scaling to just one call to scale_freqs.

anywhere taylens appears refer to the taylens paper and github.
