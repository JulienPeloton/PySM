remove samples, bandpass model. Add comment that options for bpass shapes will be added.

comment that default maps are smootehd to degree scale. Will add option for smoothing to experiment beam.

input_dirr needs to go

add option to include certain components

output only the sum of chosen components by default

add seed for numpy random stuff. np.random.seed(seed). do this in taylens (simulate_tebp_correlated) and in noise realisation.

change polarisation scaling to just one call to scale_freqs.

anywhere taylens appears refer to the taylens paper and github.
